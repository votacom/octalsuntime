This is an Android application that implements the octal solar time.

Octal solar time is a location-specific time system that defines a day as the time between two consecutive solar midnights.
Called 24 hours in the regular clock system, this day is divided into 8 equally long octal hours.
Each octal hour is divided into 64 equally long octal minutes.
Each octal minute is divided into 64 equally long octal seconds.

The clock is visualized by an hour finger that runs one cycle per day, with 0 (solar midnight) at the bottom and 4 (solar noon) at the top.
