A clock that shows the octal solar time of your location.

Octal solar time is a location-specific time system that defines a day as the time between two consecutive solar midnights. Known to contain 24 hours in the regular clock system, a day is divided into 8 equally long octal hours. Each octal hour is divided into 64 equally long octal minutes. Each octal minute is divided into 64 equally long octal seconds.

The clock is visualized by an hour finger that runs one cycle per day, with 0 (solar midnight) at the bottom and 4 (solar noon) at the top. In addition, the octal hour and minute is also shown digitally as a three-digit octal number in the center. A golden arch visualizes the time between sunrise and sunset.
